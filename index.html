                experienced in IoT system, Image processing, and Python programming. I also had practical experience in

                        <p>"What I perceive as a less favorable trait and am actively working on improving are..."</p>
                        <li>The prioritization of tasks is crucial, but often I find myself spending too much time
                            contemplating the order of importance in my mind, which then impacts the actual execution of
                            tasks.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li> In continuation of the above, personally, I tend to plan ahead and, if things don't go
                            according to the laid-out plan, it often leads to dissatisfaction and a sense of
                            frustration. This could also be described as a lack of flexibility in approaching life.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li> Tends to experience mood swings and finds it challenging to suppress behaviors. If
                            dissatisfied or experiencing certain emotions, tends to express them clearly through facial
                            expressions.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li> At this moment, I still can't figure how to use the character as a perfectionist to improve
                            of leading a high-quality life in appropiate ways.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>I approach everything with care. If I make a mistake, I don't give up. Instead of giving up,
                            I'll reset and strive to move forward with determination.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li> I am detail-oriented and thorough in my work. I check tasks multiple times, paying
                            attention and identifying errors, even in small details.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li>I am punctual and reliable when it comes to appointments at various times
                            unless there are emergency circumstances. I often complete tasks on time, prioritizing
                            tasks, well-organized approach to managing my schedule, and planning my
                            daily routines.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li>I'm aware of etiquette and avoid speaking loudly in inappropriate places.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li>I'm open to new opportunities and eager to gain experiences from different countries.

                        <li>I'm considerate to the other's potential, able to listen, and capable of assigning people to
                            tasks that suit their abilities.</li>
